      <p>My mother's banana bread has been one of my favorite treats since I was a kid. This recipe is perfect for when
            you have a bunch of bananas that are ripening too fast!</p>  
    
      <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>2 &frac13; cups mashed bananas (about 4 large or 4 &frac12; medium ripe bananas)</li>
          <li>A pinch of salt</li>
          <li>7 Tbsp white sugar</li>
          <li>&frac12; Tbsp dark brown sugar</li>
          <li>&frac12; cup light olive oil</li>
          <li>&frac12; + &frac18; cup rolled oats</li>
          <li>1 tsp baking soda</li>
          <li>2 tsp baking powder</li>
          <li>3 large eggs, beaten</li>
          <li>1 &frac34; cups all-purpose flour</li>
          <li>&frac14; cup flaxseed meal</li>
          <li>3 Tbsp hemp seeds</li>
          <li>1 Tbsp chia seeds (optional)</li>
          <li>&frac12; cup walnuts, chopped</li>
        </ul>

      <h2>Steps</h2>
      Note: instead of 2 pans, this can be baked in a muffin pan. Fill each muffin cup liner to &frac34; full, 
      bake for 18-25 minutes.
        <ol>
          <li>Preheat oven to 350 &deg;F. Line two 8x4 inch pans with parchment paper.</li>
          <li>Mash bananas and measure.</li>
          <li>Add the ingredients in order, stir in a large bowl. Fold in the walnuts.</li>
          <li>Pour evenly into the two pans and bake for 45-55 minutes.</li>
          <li>Cool on a rack for 5 minutes, lift the parchment paper and transfer the loaves to the rack to cool more. 
              Slice and serve.</li>
        </ol>
